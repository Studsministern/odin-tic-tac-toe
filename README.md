# odin-tic-tac-toe

A project for creating the game Tic-Tac-Toe on a webpage for [The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript). The page is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A live version can be viewed [on GitHub pages](https://studsministern.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/). The JavaScript file uses factory functions to create the player objects, and uses modules for the gameflow, handling events etc. This approach minimizes the amount of global code.
